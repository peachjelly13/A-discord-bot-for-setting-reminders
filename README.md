# A-discord-bot-for-setting-reminders
This project is a Discord bot that helps users create and manage reminders. It uses the discord.js library to interact with the Discord API and allows users to set reminders using specific commands. The bot saves reminders to a file and checks periodically to send reminders to users at the appropriate times. Additionally, the bot can generate short URLs.

__Show Reminders__: Users can display all active reminders.

__Send Reminders__: The bot sends a direct message to users when their reminder is due.

__Persistent Storage__: Reminders are saved to a file and reloaded when the bot restarts.
